# About the Files

## script.js:

Adapted the inherited vanilla JS to use jQuery.

### With some fun changes:

On submit, the user text is cleared out and the focus is returned to the text area.

When items are deleted, they fade out rather than immediately disappear.

## index.html

Inherited page from original project/assignment
Changed title.
Updated jQuery version to 3.7.1 with updated SHA integrity check.

Changed the submit button to read "GO!" because I feel it is more motivating for a to do list.

## style.css:

Inherited from original project/assignment
